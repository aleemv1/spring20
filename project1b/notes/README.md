## Part 0: Notes on Projects Moving Forward

### Project Descriptions

In the last few projects, the project descriptions have included several detailed step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish certain tasks, along with several images and animated GIFs demonstrating the process. While these can be super helpful when you are just starting out and don't know anything about Unity, by this point we assume you know how to navigate around the Unity Editor as well as understand understand general Unity concepts and terminology. As such, many parts of the project descriptions may describe more about functionality and less about the specific implementation details except where necessary, as you should be able to think through how you will accomplish something and what limitations your approach could have. Additionally, the number of images and GIFs will also be reduced and only provided where necessary, for example when trying to convey a point about a substantially new concept.

### Scripting

In previous projects, you were only allowed to reference and use a small set of classes within your scripts based on what we had covered in class. However, by this point we assume you know how to appropriately use the documentation and its examples to learn by yourself, and as such you are no longer restricted from using or referencing any of the classes or features that Unity offers. Note that individual parts of a project description could still stipulate you utilize a specific class or approach in your implementation, and as such you should make sure you are familiar with requirements in the project description since that is the basis of what you'll be graded on.

Additionally, you are allowed to refer to Unity docs, Google searches, Stack Overflow, online tutorials, and other similar resources to help clarify concepts, discover additional classes/features, and understand individual errors you may be facing in order to help you with the debugging process. **You are not, however, allowed to engage in any activities that go against the academic integrity policy**, such as copying and pasting large snippets of code from online sources, posting your code online to ask for help on forums, etc.
