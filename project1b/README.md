# Project 1B: Barrel Bouncer (Interactions)

**Due:** Friday, February 21, 2020 at 4:59:59 AM EST

In this second part of project 1, you will be implementing the core interactions of Barrel Bouncer's gameplay, both between the user input and the GameObjects in the scene as well as between the different GameObjects themselves. This project will give you some practice with utilizing the Physics system, working with prefabs, writing your own scripts, and applying critical thinking skills to determine what GameObjects and Components you should be dealing with to implement different functionalities.

You can view and play an example version of the project [here](https://connect.unity.com/p/cmsc388m-project-1b). Note that Unity Connect mutes the gameplay by default, so you will manually have to unmute it to hear the sounds.
