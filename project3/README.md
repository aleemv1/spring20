# Project 3: Barrel Bouncer AR Edition

**Due:** Wednesday, April 22, 2020 at 4:59:59 AM EDT

In project 1, you applied your knowledge of basic Unity concepts to develop a completed game from scratch. In project 2, you took that game and transformed it into a VR experience for the Oculus Quest headset. Now, with the last project in this series, you will be transforming this same game into an AR experience for your phone, where the digital balls and barrels will collide and interact with objects in the real world. 

First, you will design a setup mode that detects and visualizes planes in your environment and lets you place barrels onto them. Then you will create a gameplay mode that lets you throw balls from the center of your camera as you race against the clock to gain points for destroying the barrels. Finally, you will develop a scene to capture your facial reaction with a wooden barrel filter and share your score with friends.

We have built an example version of the project, which you can download and install onto an ARCore-compatible Android phone [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0MP1jvjmqWgwr_H7_Pb4etnTH3YnV8i/). Additionally, you may also check out [this video](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2020/cmsc388M/videos/project3.mp4) of the gameplay.
