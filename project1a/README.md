# Project 1A: Barrel Bouncer (Setup)

**Due:** Friday, February 14, 2020 at 4:59:59 AM EST

For most of this semester, you will be working on a first-person 3D game called Barrel Bouncer, where you score points by throwing balls to destroy barrels in your environment. Project 1 deals with developing this game in the Unity editor for your computer, while projects 2 & 3 deal with transforming the game into a VR and AR/MR experience, respectively.

This first part of project 1 will begin developing your Unity skills by getting you used to working with the Unity Editor and some basic C# scripting. You will learn how to find and import existing 3D models using the Unity Asset Store and online sources and then use them to build out a custom environment utlizing the scene view and the transform tools. Then, you will design a way for a user to move and fly around this environment from a first-person perspective.

You can view and play an example version of the project [here](https://connect.unity.com/p/cmsc388m-project-1a).
