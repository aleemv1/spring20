  title: 'Week 3 Examples'
  subtitle: '4 - Raycasting'
  sections:
  - heading: 'Setting the Scene'
    text: 'This scene contains a plane as the ground, a wall at the end of the
           plane, and some instances of the TargetCube prefab. Each of the
           TargetCubes contain the tag ''ColorChangeable''. Additionally, you
           have a cube as your player GameObject, similar to the second scene,
           and it contains a script called Raycast Example, which contains a
           single field that references a blue material.'
  - heading: 'Your Task'
    text: 'Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to Raycast out from
           the player, and if a TargetCube is hit, then you should change its
           material to the blue material. Additionally, you should use the
           DrawRay helper function to cast a debug ray out from the player to
           the hit point (if something was hit) or to 10,000 meters away (if
           nothing was hit). Note that you will not be able to see the Debug
           ray unless you turn on Gizmos in your Game View.'
