  sections:
  - heading: 'Playing the Scene'
    text: 'This scene is the first part of our in-class lab activity, where
           you''ll be writing your own code to implement some functionalities.
           First, get familiar with the scene by playing it in your Editor.
           You have a sphere as your player that you can move around with the
           WASD/arrow keys while following it from a third-person perspective.
           Notice that there''s a cube in the next room. You can bump into the
           cube and even push it around. What if you could detect this and then
           apply some cool custom effect when this happens?'
  - heading: 'Glow On Collision'
    text: 'We have added a script to the Cube called ''Color Changing Cube''.
           You''ll notice that it takes in three materials, that we''ve
           initialized to a glowing yellow material, a glowing red material,
           and the default material. Open up this script in your code editor
           and write some code to make the cube glow yellow when you first
           make contact with it.'
  - heading: 
    text: 'Your first approach may have been to just change the material on
           the Cube''s mesh renderer as soon as there is an OnCollisionEnter
           event. However, if you do this, you''ll notice that the Cube begins
           to glow as soon as it touches the floor. This is because a collision
           occurred between the cube and the floor. If you want to restrict it
           to only consider collision events with the Player, you can get
           information about the collider and GameObject that was hit using
           the Collision parameter. This way you can compare the GameObject''s
           identifying properties, like names and tags. Go ahead and modify
           your script so that it only begins to glow when the player hits it.'
  - heading: 
    text: 'After you have finished and tested your latest changes, you will
           notice that the cube continues to glow even after you stop touching
           it. This is because OnCollisionEnter is an event, not a state. It
           just executes a piece of code when the specific event of the cube
           colliding with another object occurs. However, there is no code
           currently defined to switch the cube''s material to something else,
           hence why it continues to have the glowing yellow material.'
  - heading: 'Finishing the OnCollision Events'
    text: 'In the same way that you implemented the first part, apply the
           RedGlowMaterial to the cube when the player continues to touch it
           and reset the material to DefaultMaterial once the Player is no
           longer touching the Cube. Test it in the Editor once you have
           finished.'
  - heading: 'Opening the Door'
    text: 'You''ll also notice that there is a sliding door in the middle of
           the wall with a room on the other side. However, if you move towards
           it, the door doesn''t open and you can''t seem to get past it. How
           could you make it automatically open when you get close to it?'
  - heading: 
    text: 'You could try adding a box collider that covers a much larger floor
           area than the door. However, that would mean you would collide into
           the collider and wouldn''t be able to get past it to actually reach
           the door. Luckily, there''s a special property of the collider
           called ''Trigger'' that allows the collider to detect collisions
           while not affecting the physics system. Go ahead and create a
           trigger around the door.'
  - heading: 
    text: 'Next, you''ll notice that the door already has a script on it called
           ''Door''. In this script we have provided you some helper methods to
           open and close the door. Write some code to open the door when
           a GameObject enters the trigger and to close the door when there''s
           no longer anything within the trigger.'
