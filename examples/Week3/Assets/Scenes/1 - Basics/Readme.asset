  - heading: 'Trying to Play'
    text: 'Click on the Play Button to enter Play Mode. Notice that nothing
           happens in the Game View. You could add scripts to get it to do
           stuff. However, isn''t Unity already supposed to handle making
           GameObjects react to physics in a realistic manner, such as allowing
           the Cube to fall via gravity?'
  - heading: 'Adding the Physics Components'
    text: 'The reason the Cube doesn''t react to Physics is because it does not
           have all of the necessary components. While it already has a box
           collider that allows it to be seen by the physics system, it
           doesn''t have a Rigidbody that gives it the physics behaviours. If
           you play the scene again after adding a Rigidbody, you''ll notice
           that the Cube falls down onto the plane.'
  - heading: 
    text: 'Try adjusting the plane''s angle to see at what point the Cube
           starts toppling over to the bottom of the plane (rather than
           settling into place) when you repeat the simulation. Once you are
           done experimenting, change it back to the original value of -20Â°.'
  - heading: 'Changing the Collider'
    text: 'Try disabling the box collider and adding a sphere collider instead.
           What happens when you click the play button?'
  - heading: ''
    text: 'Your cube seemed to roll down like a sphere! This is because what
           the physics system sees is not necessarily the same as what you see.
           Remember, mesh filters define the visual geometery, colliders define
           the geometry seen by the physics system.'
  - heading: ''
    text: 'When you are done experimenting, remove the sphere collider and
           re-enable the box collider.'
  - heading: 'Creating Friction'
    text: 'Physic materials are what give the surface of the collider special
           properties, like bounciness or friction. Go ahead and create a
           physic material, adjust its friction, and add it to both the cube
           and the plane so that the Cube now slowly slides down the plane.'
