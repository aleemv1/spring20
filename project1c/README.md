# Project 1C: Barrel Bouncer (UI & Scoring)

**Due:** Tuesday, March 3, 2020 at 4:59:59 AM EST

In this final part of project 1, you will be finishing up elements of the gameplay and creating a more cohesive storyline for Barrel Bouncer. This project is intended to give you practice with creating user interfaces, dealing with scene management, and using events and coroutines in your scripts.

You can view and play an example version of the project [here](https://connect.unity.com/p/cmsc388m-project-1c). Note that Unity Connect mutes the gameplay by default, so you will manually have to unmute it to hear the sounds.
