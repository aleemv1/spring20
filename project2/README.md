# Project 2: Barrel Bouncer VR Edition

**Due:** Monday, March 30, 2020 at 4:59:59 AM EDT

In project 1, you applied your knowledge of basic Unity concepts to develop a completed game from scratch. In this project, you will be taking that game and transforming it into a VR experience by adding in some common interactions with the headsets and motion controllers while adhering to some of the best performance and UX practices for virtual reality.

We have built and deployed an example version of the project to the VR headsets in the lab. Feel free to come in during office hours or open lab hours to try it out and get a sense for what you'll be creating.
